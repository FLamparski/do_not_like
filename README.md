Do Not Like
===========

Twitter has badly targetted in-stream adverts on every single device, and they're extremely annoying.

This is a tiny Chrome extension that automatically clicks "I Do Not Like This Ad" on every single one, which removes them from your feed.

By doing this it trains Twitters Giant Bird Brain that you do not like the adverts. Any adverts. Once you've been running this for a day or two you'll stop seeing any adverts on any device when browsing Twitter, not just the website.

Hurrah.
